Instead of bare ingestion pipeline, doc -> ingest -> kg 
	Have system for meta sorting which keeps state, and can be done at various points throughout 
	So doc(s) -> ingest -> categorize with knowledge of from what doc -> kg
		then re-sorting at any later time at doc/category/kg level for a more appropriate arrangement 
		easy because the reingestion does not need to reoccur, but rather a shuffling of the nodes
