## Thoughts
#### Instead of bare ingestion pipeline as that can lead to filthy messes of a graph, have system for meta sorting which keeps state, and can be re-shuffled at any point throughout the kg's lifespan
	(doc -> ingest -> kg) = lazy and bad if not just wrong inter-connectivity
	(doc(s) -> ingest -> categorize with knowledge of what came from which doc -> kg) = flexible, keeps state, adds another check to ensure correct placement
#### Then it's possible to re-sort at any later time at category/kg level for a more appropriate arrangement 
#### Easy because the reingestion does not need to reoccur, but rather a shuffling of the nodes, RTS tech trees on psychedelics
